# Non-Goals

## What We Do NOT Do

### 1. Verification Agency Services
We are software providers, not a manual BGV agency. We do not send field agents to visit candidate homes (Address verification is digital-only).

### 2. Resume Parsing/ATS
We are not an Application Tracking System (ATS). We do not rank candidates on *quality* of skills (e.g., Coding capability). We only verify the *truth* of their claims.

### 3. Social Media Screening
We do not crawl Facebook/Twitter/Instagram. This is a privacy minefield and low-value signal for our enterprise focus.

### 4. Subjective Reference Checks
We do not automate calling previous managers. This data is subjective and low-trust. We focus on **immutable data** (UAN, Bank Statements, Tax Records).

### 5. Modification of Candidate Data
We never auto-correct a candidate's application. If they enter the wrong PAN, we flag it. We do not fix it.
