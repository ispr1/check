# Product Vision

## Executive Summary
CHECK-360 is an **Enterprise Verification Orchestration Platform** designed to solve the "Resume Fraud" crisis in high-stakes hiring. Unlike traditional Background Verification (BGV) providers that operate as black boxes, CHECK-360 acts as a **Truth Comparator**, orchestrating widely trusted data sources (Government APIs, Court Records, Credit Bureaus) against candidate claims to derive a data-backed **Trust Score**.

## Core Value Proposition
*   **Truth Comparison, Not Just Collection:** We don't just fetch data; we diff it against candidate claims.
*   **Zero-Trust Architecture:** We assume all candidate inputs are potentially manipulated until verified against immutable sources.
*   **Explainable Trust:** We replace binary "Pass/Fail" with a nuanced, transparent Trust Score (0-100) explaining *why* a candidate is risky.
*   **Orchestrator Model:** We integrate best-in-class vendors (Surepass, AWS Rekognition) rather than rebuilding commodity verification stacks.

## The "Why"
In an era of AI-generated fake resumes and sophisticated employment fraud, manual BGV is too slow and traditional BGV is too opaque. Enterprises need a system that:
1.  **Instantaneously** verifies identity and documents.
2.  **Mathematically** calculates risk.
3.  **Auditably** proves due diligence.

## Long-Term Vision
To become the standard "Credit Score for Employability" in the Indian massive-hiring sector.
