# Problem Statement

## The Crisis: Resume Fraud at Scale
*   **Magnitude:** 20-30% of resumes in Indian tech/finance sectors contain material discrepancies.
*   **Sophistication:** Candidates use Photoshop AI, fake experience letters from shell companies, and "UAN mules" to manufacture employment history.
*   **Impact:** A single bad hire costs ~3x their annual salary, plus legal/compliance risks.

## User Friction (HR & Candidates)
*   **HR Pain:** Chasing candidates for documents, manual comparisons (Excel hell), opaque vendor reports ("Amber" status with no explanation).
*   **Candidate Pain:** "Black hole" verifications, repetitive data entry, lack of transparency on why they were rejected.

## The Gap
Existing tools are either:
*   **Aggregators:** Just fetch data dumps.
*   **Services:** Manual agencies taking 14-21 days.

There is no **Real-Time Truth Engine** that unifies Identity, Document Forensics, and Face Matching into a single decision layer.
